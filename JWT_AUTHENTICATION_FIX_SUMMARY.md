# JWT Authentication Fix - Summary

## Problem Description
Users were experiencing intermittent authorization failures where they would sometimes get unauthorized errors after logging in and need to relogin to be authorized again. The issue was caused by:

1. **Multiple Axios Instances with Conflicting Interceptors**: The application had both `axiosInstance.ts` and `api/core.ts` with different 401 error handling
2. **No Automatic Token Refresh**: JWT tokens expired after 3 hours with no refresh mechanism
3. **Race Conditions**: Multiple 401 responses could trigger simultaneous redirects to login
4. **Backend Refresh Token Issues**: Cookie name mismatches and poor error handling

## Root Cause Analysis

### Frontend Issues:
- **Duplicate Axios Instances**: `axiosInstance.ts` and `api/core.ts` both had response interceptors handling 401 errors differently
- **No Token Expiry Check**: Tokens were not checked for expiration before API calls
- **Missing Refresh Logic**: No mechanism to automatically refresh expired tokens
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple simultaneous 401 responses could cause multiple login redirects

### Backend Issues:
- **Cookie Name Mismatch**: Backend looked for "refresh_token" but frontend stored "refreshToken"
- **Limited Refresh Token Retrieval**: Only checked cookies, not Authorization header
- **Inconsistent Token Management**: Refresh token expiry was inconsistent

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Unified Token Manager (`tokenManager.ts`)
```typescript
class TokenManager {
  private isRefreshing = false;
  private refreshSubscribers: Array<(token: string) => void> = [];

  // Check if token is expired or about to expire (within 5 minutes)
  isTokenExpired(token: string): boolean

  // Refresh token with proper handling for race conditions
  async refreshToken(): Promise<string | null>

  // Check and refresh token if needed
  async ensureValidToken(): Promise<string | null>
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Prevents race conditions with `isRefreshing` flag
- Subscriber pattern for waiting requests during refresh
- Proactive token refresh (5 minutes before expiry)
- Automatic fallback to login on refresh failure

### 2. Enhanced Auth Service (`authService.ts`)
**Added:**
- `refreshToken()` method for backend communication
- `clearTokens()` utility method
- Proper refresh token storage on login
- Comprehensive error handling

**Improvements:**
- Store both access and refresh tokens on login
- Clear all tokens on logout (including refresh tokens)
- Better error handling with token cleanup

### 3. Updated API Interceptors (`api/interceptors.ts`)
**Request Interceptor:**
- Uses `tokenManager.ensureValidToken()` to check/refresh tokens before requests
- Automatic token refresh for expired tokens

**Response Interceptor:**
- Handles 401 errors with automatic token refresh retry
- Prevents multiple simultaneous login redirects
- Better error classification and handling

### 4. Deprecated Conflicting Axios Instance (`axiosInstance.ts`)
- Replaced with deprecation notice and redirect to main API instance
- Maintains backward compatibility while eliminating conflicts

### 5. Enhanced Auth Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
**Initialization:**
- Uses token manager for token validation on app startup
- Graceful fallback when token refresh fails
- Better error handling during user info retrieval

**Logout:**
- Comprehensive token cleanup using `authService.clearTokens()`
- Proper error handling even when API call fails

### 6. Backend Refresh Token Endpoint Improvements (`AuthController.cs`)
**Enhanced Token Retrieval:**
- Checks multiple cookie names: "refreshToken" and "refresh_token"
- Falls back to extracting user ID from Authorization header
- Better error handling and validation

**Response Improvements:**
- Returns both new access and refresh tokens
- Proper cookie management with consistent naming
- Extended refresh token expiry (7 days)

**Logout Improvements:**
- Clears all possible cookie variations
- Ensures complete token cleanup

## Security Improvements

1. **Proactive Token Refresh**: Tokens are refreshed 5 minutes before expiry
2. **Race Condition Prevention**: Single refresh process handles multiple simultaneous requests
3. **Comprehensive Token Cleanup**: All tokens cleared on logout/failure
4. **Fallback Authentication**: Multiple methods to retrieve refresh tokens
5. **Consistent Cookie Management**: Standardized cookie naming and cleanup

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **Login and Verify Token Storage**: Check localStorage for both tokens
2. **Token Expiry Simulation**: Manually expire token and verify auto-refresh
3. **Multiple Simultaneous Requests**: Open multiple tabs and make concurrent API calls
4. **Network Interruption**: Test behavior during network issues
5. **Logout Verification**: Ensure all tokens are cleared

### Automated Testing:
1. **Token Refresh Flow**: Unit tests for token manager
2. **Interceptor Behavior**: Test 401 handling and retry logic
3. **Race Condition Prevention**: Concurrent request tests
4. **Error Handling**: Various failure scenarios

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code:
1. **Replace axiosInstance imports**:
   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { axiosInstance } from './services/axiosInstance';
   
   // New
   import api from './services/api';
   ```

2. **Use centralized token management**:
   ```typescript
   // Old - Direct localStorage access
   const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
   
   // New - Through auth service
   import authService from './services/authService';
   const validToken = await tokenManager.ensureValidToken();
   ```

### Environment Variables (Backend):
Ensure these are properly configured:
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT signing
- `ISSUER`: JWT issuer
- `AUDIENCE`: JWT audience
- `FRONTEND_DOMAIN`: For CORS and redirects

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced Login Interruptions**: Automatic token refresh prevents unnecessary logins
2. **Better User Experience**: Seamless authentication without forced relogins
3. **Optimized API Calls**: Token validation before requests reduces failed calls
4. **Race Condition Elimination**: Prevents multiple simultaneous refresh attempts

## Monitoring and Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging for:
- Token refresh attempts and results
- Authentication failures and causes
- Network errors and fallbacks
- User session management

Monitor these logs to identify any remaining authentication issues and optimize further.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive fix addresses all identified authentication issues:
- ✅ Eliminates conflicting axios interceptors
- ✅ Implements automatic token refresh
- ✅ Prevents race conditions
- ✅ Improves backend token handling
- ✅ Enhances security and user experience

The solution provides a robust, maintainable authentication system that handles edge cases gracefully and provides excellent user experience.
