1. **Verify Address Display**: Check that addresses are properly displayed in the tables
2. **Test Sorting**: Confirm that the Address column sorts correctly
3. **Test Search**: Verify that searching by address works as expected
4. **Test Edit/Delete**: Ensure all customers and vendors can be edited and deleted
5. **Test Create**: Verify that new customers and vendors can be created with addresses

## Impact Assessment

2. **Address Validation**: Add client-side validation for address formats
3. **Export Functionality**: Update export functions to include address data
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure address column displays well on mobile devices
